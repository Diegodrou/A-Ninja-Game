# Little Ninja

Description: 
This game is a 2D platformer I made with pygame. 
I started the project because I wanted to learn to code with python and I thought making this game would be a fun project to do so.


How to play:Press f to attack, press space to restart or to load the next level(when in a menu screen), press the left arrow key to go left, press the right arrow key to go right, press the up arrow key to jump.
